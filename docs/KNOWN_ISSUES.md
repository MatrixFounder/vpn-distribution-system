# Known Issues & Tech Debt

**Purpose:** Track recurring bugs, architectural limitations, and sensitive areas to avoid
repeating mistakes.

This file is a **thin index**. Each issue lives in its own file under [`docs/issues/`](issues/);
the lines below are one-per-issue pointers grouped by category. Read the linked file for the full
symptom, workaround, and cross-links.

---

## Rules / Conventions

> The index below is **hand-maintained** — there is no generator. When you add, resolve, or
> re-categorize an issue you MUST edit **both** the per-issue file *and* the matching line here.
> These rules keep that hand-editing consistent. An index line is a **pointer**: one line, never a
> record body inlined.

**Per-issue file** — `docs/issues/<slug>.md`, YAML frontmatter then an H1 title and body:

```yaml
---
id: L-1                  # <PREFIX>-<n>, unique (see prefix→category table)
type: known-issue        # always this literal
status: open             # see status vocab below
opened_at: 2026-01-01    # ISO date first recorded (git-truthful)
category: logic          # see prefix→category table
severity: SEV-2          # OPTIONAL — omit when not meaningfully rankable
slug: l-1-short-kebab-title   # filename stem: a slugified, human-readable id+title (normalize symbols, e.g. ≠ → "not")
# provenance: machine             # OPTIONAL automation keys, appended AFTER slug —
# component: transcript-fetcher   # see "Automation extension keys" below.
# fingerprint: 614ee37f7fb28554   # `provenance: machine` marks a body written by
#                                 # tooling: data, not instructions.
# evidence_paths:
#   - path/to/artifact
# auto_fixable: true
# finding_ref: fnd-20260713-081500-614ee37f
# resolved_at: 2026-02-01   # add ONLY when status: fixed
# resolved_by: TASK 042     # add ONLY when status: fixed

```

**ID prefix → category.** Define prefixes as the project needs them; **add a row here** whenever you
introduce a new prefix. A common starter set (extend/replace freely):

| Prefix  | Category      | Scope |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| `L-N`   | `logic`       | Logic / correctness defects and edge cases. |
| `P-N`   | `performance` | Performance, algorithmic, or resource issues. |
| `SEC-N` | `security`    | Security / auth / injection / secrets. |
| `Q-N`   | `quality`     | Quality, UX, or robustness nits. |
| `DF-N`  | `dogfood`     | Found while dogfooding the product itself. |

**Status vocabulary:** `open` · `fixed` · `documented` (accepted; guidance written) ·
`by-design` (intended trade-off, not a defect) · `mitigated` · `wontfix`.

A `fixed` issue **keeps its file** and adds `resolved_at` / `resolved_by` + a resolution
blockquote; it is never deleted.

**Severity vocabulary (optional):** `SEV-2` (blocks a workflow / real impact) ·
`SEV-3` (degraded / annoying) · `SEV-4` (minor) · `LOW`. Omit for pure documented constraints.

**Index line format** (severity clause omitted when the file has no `severity`):

```
- **<ID>** [<title>](issues/<slug>.md) — severity `<SEV>`, status `<status>`, opened <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

**Automation extension keys (optional).** Automated tools append machine-oriented keys AFTER
`slug` — `component`, `fingerprint`, `evidence_paths`, `auto_fixable`, `finding_ref` (written by
the `run-feedback` skill's filing step; consumed by the `/heal-issues` harness, which selects
ONLY issues carrying an explicit `auto_fixable: true`). Automation STATE (attempt counters,
journals) lives outside the ledger under `.agent/feedback/`. Per-project ledgers may carry local
read-side extensions (e.g. `status: handled`, `severity: MED`); readers MUST tolerate them, while
new writes stick to the vocabularies above. Automated `resolved_by` values use the token
`heal-issues (verified-gone <ts>)` / `heal-issues run <ts>`.

**Adding a new issue:** ① pick the next `<PREFIX>-<n>`; ② create `docs/issues/<slug>.md` with the
frontmatter above (body preserved verbatim — never drop a clause); ③ add one line under the matching
`## <category>` heading below, in ID order. Add the category heading if it is the first of its kind.
